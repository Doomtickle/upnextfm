        UpNext is your community jukebox.
        We're a group of strangers who met each other through internet chatrooms (reddit.com/r/joinrobin) and
        found shared common interests through sharing and listening to music together in real time. Our music
        channels are a melting pot of different genres and sounds from all over the world that reflect our diverse
        userbase. Join us for a fun and unique listening experience by sharing your songs on the playlist or
        spamming your favorite custom emotes in chat; upnext.fm is a close-knit community where everyone and
        every sound is welcome :)
